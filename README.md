# Project description
The chosen type of project is *“Implementing your own data mining or machine learning algorithm”*.

Selected algorithm: *hierarchical agglomerative clustering algorithm*.

Selected programming language: *TypeScript*.

Description of the project: This project focuses on implementing the Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering algorithm in TypeScript. The algorithm will provide:
- Support for complete linkage and single linkage.
- Display of intermediate distance tables for each step calculated using Manhattan distance.
- Visualization of the clustering process using a dendrogram.
- Automatic determination of the number of clusters at different levels.
- Proposed approaches

Algorithms: single linkage HAC algorithm and complete linkage HAC algorithm, distance table calculation for each iteration (using Manhattan distance), calculation of the groups of the clustering algorithm.

## Technologies: 
- **React.js** for the dynamic and interactive UI (intermediate tables, input of the user data, etc.)
- **D3.js** library to visually represent the merging of clusters with a dendrogram
- **Node.js** and **npm** for the development environment and GitHub for version control and collaboration.

# Expected Outcomes/Goals
Functional Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering Algorithm with an ability to process input datasets and output clusters with support for complete linkage and single linkage methods, visual dendrogram showing the hierarchical clustering process and cluster identification. User interaction includes input of the dataset and select of the linkage method. The verification of the algorithm. Test of our implementation and comparison with the existing Python library.
